    /**
     The purpose of this function is to allow you to observe notifications posted to the NotificationCenter for a specific notification name.
     When you call this function, it sets up an observer for the given notification name using NotificationCenter.default.addObserver.
     Whenever a notification with the specified name is posted, the closure provided to addObserver is called.

     In this case, the closure yields the object property of the notification object. This object can be of any type, hence the use of the Any? type.

     The AsyncStream type allows you to produce a stream of values asynchronously. In this case, the observeNotifications
     function returns an AsyncStream that produces a stream of values whenever the observer is triggered.

     The @discardableResult attribute is used to indicate that the return value of this function may be ignored
     without producing a compiler warning.

     Finally, the continuation.onTermination closure is called when the stream is closed. It removes the observer
     from the NotificationCenter to prevent any further notifications from being observed.

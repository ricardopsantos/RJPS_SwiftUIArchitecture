/// - Parameters:
///   - lock: The lock object to synchronize on.
///   - closure: The closure containing the code to be synchronized.
/// - Returns: The result of the closure.
/// - It requires passing a lock object of type Any, which can be any object that can serve as a synchronization point.
/// - The closure containing the synchronized code is passed as an argument.
/// - It's less type-safe because it can accept any object as the lock.
/// - It's slightly less efficient than Swift-native synchronization due to the overhead of Objective-C runtime functions.

///
/// - Parameters:
///   - lock: The NSLock object to synchronize on.
///   - closure: The closure containing the code to be synchronized.
/// - Returns: The result of the closure.
/// - It requires passing an NSLock instance explicitly.
/// - The closure containing the synchronized code is passed as an argument.
/// - It's more type-safe because it explicitly requires an NSLock instance.
/// - It's slightly more efficient than Objective-C synchronization because it directly calls Swift methods.
/// - defer { lock.unlock() } ensures that the lock is always released, even if an error occurs or an early return is encountered.

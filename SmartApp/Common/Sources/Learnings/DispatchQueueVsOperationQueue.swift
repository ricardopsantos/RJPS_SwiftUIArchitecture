        // an order, the barista quickly handles each task one by one, either on
        // a first-come-first-serve basis or as a background task.
        //
        // When to Use DispatchQueue?
        //  - When you need simple concurrency.
        //  - When tasks are independent of each other.
        //  - When you need to update the UI on the main thread.

        // Unlike the barista, the manager can prioritize tasks, manage dependencies
        // between tasks, and even cancel tasks if needed.
        //
        // When to Use?
        // - When you need more control over task execution.
        // - When tasks depend on each other.
        // - When you need to cancel tasks or set priorities.
